An open source implementation and test software for the algorithms described in the paper:

Potter, A. (2024). An Algorithmic approach to analyzing rhetorical structures. In M. Strube, C. Braud, C. Hardmeier, J. J. Li, S. Loaiciga, A. Zeldes, & C. Li (Eds.), Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Discourse (CODI 2024) (pp. 1-11). Association for Computational Linguistics. 

Three algorithms are provided. The first of these, called Reenactment, recreates the abstract process whereby structures are created, following the dynamic of coherence development, starting from simple relational propositions, and combining these to form complex expressions which are in turn integrated to define the comprehensive discourse organization. The second algorithm, called Composition, implements Marcu’s strong nuclearity assumption. It uses a simple inference mechanism to demonstrate the reducibility of complex structures to simple relational propositions. The third algorithm, called Compression, picks up where Marcu’s assumption leaves off, providing a generalized fully scalable procedure for progressive reduction of relational propositions to their simplest accessible forms. These inferred reductions may then be recycled to produce RST diagrams of abridged texts. The algorithms provided here are useful in positioning computational descriptions of rhetorical structures as discursive processes, allowing researchers to go beyond static diagrams and look into their formative and interpretative significance.
